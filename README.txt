MELIATOR:

Purpose: To create an effective, open source, modular framework to simulate vehicle traffic and provide insights to changes that can be made to improve driving conditions

Methods: This program will utilize classes representing Roads, the lanes and objects within them, and the cars that drive on them. A manager class will handle each iteration in unit time, and cars will maneuver on roads according to a set of "behaviors" recorded in a profile class. The state at the end of each iteration will be forwarded to a renderer which displays the road conditions.
